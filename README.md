# EchoShadows
 
ECHO SHADOWS is an immersive light installation that transforms live music into a visual display. As participants stand in front of the light fixtures, the beats and rhythms are translated into vibrant color changes on the surface, casting dynamic and colored shadows that shift with the music. Through this fusion of sound, light, and shadow, Echo Shadows makes tangible the connection between musical rhythms and visual changes, offering visitors a unique sensory experience as they become part of the evolving dance of light and shadow, engaging audiences as they immerse in silhouettes shaped by the rhythm and themselves.
